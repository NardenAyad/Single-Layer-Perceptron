# Single-Layer-Perceptron
## Training the Perceptron model on the iris dataset

The purpose of this example is to create the model that can classify the different species of the iris flower. Scikit-learn, a free software machine learning library for Python, has a inbuilt datasets for the iris classification problem.
The dataset consists of:
- 150 samples
- 3 labels (species of iris): setosa, virginica, versicolor
- 4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width(in cm)
